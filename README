The program accepts the input and call the function walk if W is the first character of the input line.
The function histogram is called if H is the first character of the input line. 
Both function walk and histogram utilizes the function setup to simulate the drunkard walking. The new seed is returned 
to the function for future use. 
After executing the simulation, output will be generated according to the description. 

Potential improvement: use a global static variable for seed instead of returning the new seed to the function.
